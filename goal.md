Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

Rule #3: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor



immediate goals:

1. learn Sass
2. learn React
